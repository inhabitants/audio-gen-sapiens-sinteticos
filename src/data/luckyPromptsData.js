    // 1. Studio Portrait
    "A hyper-realistic studio portrait of an elderly jazz musician looking directly into the lens, wearing a vintage tweed suit. The lighting is soft and diffuse, created by a large octabox placed slightly above, emphasizing the texture of the skin, visible pores, and deep laugh lines without retouching. The background is a textured, hand-painted charcoal gray canvas backdrop. Shot on a Hasselblad H6D-100c with an 80mm f/1.9 lens, extremely shallow depth of field with focus strictly on the eyes.",
    "A hyper-realistic studio portrait of a young futuristic pilot looking directly into the lens, wearing a high-collar flight jacket with glowing accents. The lighting is soft and diffuse, emphasizing the texture of the skin, visible pores, and fine vellus hair. The background is a textured, hand-painted slate blue canvas backdrop. Shot on a Hasselblad H6D-100c with an 80mm f/1.9 lens, extremely shallow depth of field with focus strictly on the eyes, creating a creamy bokeh falloff.",

    // 2. Neon City
    "A cinematic wide shot of a solitary cyborg detective standing in a rainy Tokyo alley at night, illuminated by the glow of pink and blue neon signs. The subject is lighting a cigarette. The scene is moody and dark, with strong teal and orange color grading. Wet pavement reflects the lights, adding volumetric fog. Captured with an Arri Alexa Mini LF and Panavision anamorphic lenses, featuring characteristic oval bokeh and horizontal lens flares.",

    // 3. Sun-drenched
    "A candid, raw photograph of a skateboarder in a sun-drenched Venice Beach skatepark during midday. The lighting is hard and direct sunlight, casting sharp, distinct shadows across the subject's face. The subject is wearing a loose graphic tee and torn jeans. The composition is dynamic, capturing a fleeting moment of mid-air suspension. Shot on a Leica M6 with Kodak Portra 400 film, showing visible film grain and high contrast.",

    // 7. Floating Room
    "A gravity-defying photograph of a business man floating suspended in mid-air inside a chaotic office cubicle. The subject's pose is relaxed, reading a paper. Surrounding objects like staplers, papers, and coffee mugs are also slowly levitating. The lighting is moody and cinematic, coming from a fluorescent lamp, creating realistic shadows on the floor. The fabric of the suit hangs naturally as if unaffected by gravity. Captured with a high shutter speed to freeze the motion, sharp focus, fine grain.",

    // 12. Portal Door
    "A conceptual shot of a freestanding, open door frame placed in the middle of a snowy field. Through the open door, we see a warm, sunlit tropical beach. A hiker is stepping through the threshold, one foot in the snow, the other in the sand. The lighting contrasts sharply: blue light of snow vs warm golden light. Captured with a wide-angle 24mm lens."
